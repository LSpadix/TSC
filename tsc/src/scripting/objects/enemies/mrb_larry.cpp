/**
 * Class: Larry
 *
 * Parent: L<Enemy>
 *
 * If you just heard some loud "BOOOM!", then you have met I<Larry>.
 * On exploding, it destroys all enemies (and injures Alex) nearby. Really
 * dangerous is a situation with multiple larries, which can result
 * in a giant chain explosion.
 *
 * =head2 Events
 *
 * =over
 *
 * =item [Downgrade]
 *
 * This event gets triggered each time the Larry takes a hit.
 * It receives two arguments: how many hits it already received,
 * and how many it may receive at maximum before it dies (the
 * latter is always 2). If an already fused larry dies from
 * reaching the end of fuse, no Downgrade event is issued.
