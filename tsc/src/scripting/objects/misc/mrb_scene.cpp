 * Method: Scene::play

 *
 * Calling this method plays the scene with the name `scene`, which
 * has to be a string, e.g. "01_prologue" (to play the prologue scene).
 * The canonical scene name mapping can be found in the source code
 * of the cScene::Load_Scene() function.
 *
 * This method returns, but on the next frame update after return
 * the game mode switches to scene mode. Once the scene has completed,
 * the game mode returns to level mode in the level that was active
 * when scene play was started.
 *
 * An exception is raised if the requested scene does not exist.
 *
 * *Remark*: This means that this method does not block until the
 * scene has finished!
