# Note that strictly the .po files depend on the .pot file, but the
# .pot file should only ever be updated on purpose and not as part of
# updating the .po files, as it is the reference file for all
# translators and thus must stay the same. Changes in it require all
# translators to review their translation. Also, it is likely that
# translators will not send in the changed .pot file. Therefore this
# task is not a file task on the .pot file; the .po files depend on
# the .pot file, and it would be autocalled that way when calling
# make on a .po file.
